    // ... other categories
  };
  
  const weights = categoryWeights[category];
  
  // Calculate weighted performance score
  const performanceScore = (
    (business.speedScore * weights.speed) +
    (business.valueScore * weights.value) +
    (business.qualityScore * weights.quality) + 
    (business.reliabilityScore * weights.reliability)
  );
  
  // Apply recency weighting
  const recencyMultiplier = calculateRecencyWeight(reviews);
  
  // Apply tier enhancements (minimal impact)
  const tierBonus = {
    "free": 0,
    "starter": 0.02, // 2% bonus for tie-breaking
    "pro": 0.03,     // 3% bonus for tie-breaking  
    "power": 0.05    // 5% bonus for tie-breaking
  };
