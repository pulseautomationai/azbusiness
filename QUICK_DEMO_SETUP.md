# Quick Demo Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Demo Setup

Since the enhanced business profile is now connected, here's how to quickly set up demo data to see all the enhanced features:

### Step 1: Verify the Enhanced Profile is Working
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/hvac-services/phoenix/cactus-mechanical`
2. You should now see the **enhanced business profile** with tabs instead of the old basic profile

### Step 2: Set Up Different Plan Tiers (Manual via Convex Dashboard)

#### Option A: Via Convex Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your **Convex Dashboard**: `https://dashboard.convex.dev`
2. Navigate to **Data** â†’ **businesses** table
3. Find "Cactus Mechanical" (or any business)
4. **Edit the business record**:
   - Set `planTier` to `"free"` (default)
   - Set `claimed` to `false`
   - Set `verified` to `false`

#### Option B: Via Browser Console (Quick Method)
1. Open your business page in browser
2. Open **Developer Tools** (F12)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Paste this code to update a business to PRO tier:

```javascript
// Find the business ID from the page (check React DevTools or Network tab)
// Replace 'BUSINESS_ID_HERE' with actual ID

fetch('/api/convex', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: 'mutation',
    variables: {
      businessId: 'BUSINESS_ID_HERE',
      updates: {
        planTier: 'pro',
        claimed: true,
        verified: true
      }
    }
  })
});
```

### Step 4: Add Demo Business Content

To see the AI-enhanced content, you can manually add some demo content via Convex Dashboard:

2. Find the record for your business (match `businessId`)
3. Edit and add:

  "serviceCards": [
    {
      "name": "Emergency Repair",
      "description": "24/7 emergency HVAC repair services",
      "pricing": "$150-300",
      "icon": "wrench",
      "featured": true
    },
    {
      "name": "AC Installation", 
      "description": "Professional air conditioning installation",
      "pricing": "$3,000-8,000",
      "icon": "snowflake",
      "featured": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Demo Flow Testing

### Step 6: Demo Multiple Businesses

Create 3 demo businesses by repeating the above steps:

- **Business 3**: Power tier (claimed, verified, featured)

This gives you a complete demo flow showing the progression from Free â†’ Pro â†’ Power.

### Troubleshooting

#### If Enhanced Profile Not Showing:

- âœ… Check that `businessContent.ts` functions are deployed
- âœ… Add demo content manually via Convex Dashboard
