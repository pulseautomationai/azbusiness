## Business Listing Page ‚Äî Component-Level Visibility Spec

This document defines the design and implementation plan for a dynamic, AI-enriched business listing page for an Arizona local business directory. It is built on a modern tech stack (React Router v7, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Convex, Clerk, and Polar.sh). This document should be used by Claude or other AI agents to generate implementation plans, component tasks, and developer checklists.

The goal is to:

1. Render rich listings by default (Power-tier), and use visibility logic to hide or disable features for Pro or Free tiers.
2. Make each listing valuable and persuasive enough to get the business to claim it.
3. Use AI and automation to enrich content, offer compelling upgrade paths, and manage everything scalably.
