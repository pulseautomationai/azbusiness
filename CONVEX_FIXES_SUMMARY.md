# Convex Document Limit Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Dashboard Statistics
- **Problem**: Hardcoded values were overriding actual platform statistics
- **Fix**: Removed hardcoded values in `adminAnalytics.ts`, now using real platform data

### 2. GeoScraper Metrics Collection
- **Problem**: Metrics queries were reading too many documents
- **Fix**: 
  - Added pagination with 1000 document limits
  - Implemented rate limiting (only 10% of high-frequency metrics recorded)
  - Changed cleanup from hourly to daily

### 3. Review Fetching Optimization
- **Problem**: Trying to fetch unlimited reviews per business
- **Fix**: Limited to 200 reviews per business (20 pages at ~10 reviews/page)

### 4. Queue Operations
- **Problem**: `bulkAddToQueue` and `getQueueStatus` were hitting document limits
- **Fixes**:
  - Added batch size limit of 100 items for bulk operations
  - Used indexes for all queue queries
  - Limited status checks to recent items (24 hours)
  - Changed queue status to return numeric values instead of strings

### 5. Review Sync Queries
- **Problem**: `getBusinessesForSync` was collecting all businesses
- **Fix**: Added `take()` limit based on requested batch size

## Key Rules Established

1. **Always use `.take()` with a limit** - Never use `.collect()` without a limit
2. **Use indexes for filtering** - Define and use proper indexes for common queries
3. **Batch processing** - Process in chunks of 50-100 items
4. **Time-based filtering** - Limit queries to recent data (24-48 hours)
5. **Rate limiting** - For high-frequency operations, only record a sample

## Updated Functions

- `convex/adminAnalytics.ts` - Fixed statistics calculations
- `convex/geoScraperMetrics.ts` - Added rate limiting and pagination
- `convex/geoScraperQueue.ts` - Fixed all queue operations with indexes and limits
- `convex/reviewSync.ts` - Added limits to business queries
- `convex/geoScraperAPI.ts` - Limited to 200 reviews per business

## Monitoring

To verify the fixes work:
1. Check admin dashboard shows correct statistics (~1,000 businesses)
2. Monitor review queue processing without document limit errors
3. Verify bulk operations complete successfully
4. Check metrics collection doesn't overwhelm the system

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for any remaining document limit errors
2. Consider adding more specific indexes if needed
3. Implement pagination UI for admin interfaces
4. Add error handling for edge cases
