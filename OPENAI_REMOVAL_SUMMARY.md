# OpenAI Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Removed `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env` file
- ✅ Removed `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env.example`

### 2. Package Dependencies  
- ✅ Removed `@ai-sdk/openai` package from `package.json`
- Note: Run `npm install` to update your node_modules

### 3. Code Updates

#### `/convex/aiAnalysisIntegration.ts`
- Changed default AI provider from 'openai' to 'gemini'
- Removed OpenAI provider check logic
- Removed entire OpenAI API call section
- Updated error messages to remove "OpenAI fallback" references
- Simplified provider logic to only support Gemini or mock

#### `/convex/ai/analyzeReview.ts`
- Completely rewrote to remove all OpenAI code
- Simplified to only support Gemini or mock analyzer
- Removed OpenAI API calls and related error handling
- Updated comments and documentation

#### `/convex/http.ts`
- Commented out OpenAI imports
- Disabled the chat endpoint that used OpenAI
- Returns 501 (Not Implemented) with message about OpenAI removal

### 4. System Behavior

The system now works as follows:

1. **With Gemini API Key**: Uses Gemini for AI analysis
2. **Without Gemini API Key**: Falls back to mock analyzer
3. **Default Provider**: Changed from 'openai' to 'gemini'

### 5. Testing

Created test script at `scripts/test-ai-providers.ts` to verify:
- Environment is correctly configured
- OpenAI is fully removed
- System is ready to use Gemini or mock analyzer

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to remove the OpenAI package from node_modules
2. If you want to use Gemini, add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` to the `.env` file
3. The mock analyzer will work automatically without any API keys

## Benefits

- Simplified codebase with one less external dependency
- Reduced complexity in AI provider selection logic
- No more OpenAI API costs or rate limits
- System still fully functional with mock analyzer
