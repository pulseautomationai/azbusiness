      "snippet": "I joined the Thomas Loyalty program just over a year ago. I own and manage three short-term rental properties, so having a reliable company on call for any mishaps is critical to my business‚Äîand I was willing to pay a premium for peace of mind. Unfortunately, my experience with Thomas has been consistently disappointing.\n\nOn three separate occasions, they went to the wrong property, disturbing my guests. Even more concerning is their inability to communicate effectively, fix issues, or schedule appointments in a timely manner. For example, an urgent electrical problem was canceled the same day, with the earliest reschedule offered three days later‚Äîdespite their supposed 24-hour guarantee.\n\nWhen they do come out, 80% of the time it takes multiple visits to resolve an issue. I am currently still trying to get them to repair the top oven of a double oven for the fourth time (due to repeated diagnostic errors and incorrect parts). Similarly, they've been to my home three times to fix a shower that only gets hot, each time arriving unprepared and uninformed despite clear notes from prior visits. The high employee turnover doesn‚Äôt help, either.\n\nI've tried to be patient because their technicians and staff are friendly, but it‚Äôs been problem after problem. Running Airbnbs means I have tight windows to get repairs done, and Thomas has been unresponsive to my attempts to schedule service since June 17. When I asked to cancel my loyalty membership so I could find a company that actually delivers, I was told I‚Äôm locked into a one-year contract‚Äîpaying for a service that doesn‚Äôt respond or fix the issues it‚Äôs hired to handle.\n\nThomas does not stand by their guarantees, and I would not recommend them to anyone, especially not to those managing STRs where time and reliability are paramount.",
