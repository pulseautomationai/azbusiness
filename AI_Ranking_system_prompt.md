# üöÄ Implementation Prompt: AI-Powered Ranking & Achievement System

## üìã Project Overview

I need you to implement a comprehensive **AI-driven business ranking and achievement system** for our Arizona business directory. This system will analyze customer reviews using AI, generate quality-based rankings, award achievements, and drive tier upgrades through strategic gamification.

## üìö Reference Documentation

Please carefully review these comprehensive design documents I've created:
1. **AI Algorithm Tagging Schema System** - Complete tag structure for AI analysis
2. **AI-Driven Achievement & Award Schema System** - Full achievement system with tier progression

4. **4-Tier Business Model** - Free ($0) ‚Üí Starter ($9) ‚Üí Pro ($29) ‚Üí Power ($97) ‚Üí Pulse Automation ($197-697)

## üéØ Core Requirements

### **Quality-First Philosophy**
- Rankings based on **review quality, not quantity** 
- AI analyzes review content for excellence indicators, mastery mentions, problem-solving ability
- 3 reviews of exceptional quality should outrank 50 mediocre reviews

- **Starter ($9)**: Bronze + Silver achievements  
- **Pro ($29)**: Bronze + Silver + Gold achievements
- **Power ($97)**: All achievements including Platinum
- Achievement eligibility creates natural upgrade pressure

### **Clean Consumer Experience**
- **NO upgrade prompts** on customer-facing pages (homepage, category, business listings)
- Rankings and achievements displayed naturally based on business tier "unlocks"
- Pure consumer experience focused on finding quality services

### **Conversion-Focused Business Dashboard**
- Rich analytics showing ranking position and achievement progress
- Clear upgrade triggers: "You qualify for Gold achievements - upgrade to Pro"

## üé™ Special Considerations

### **Arizona Business Focus**
- All rankings and achievements should reflect local Arizona market dynamics
- Industry-specific achievements for HVAC, Plumbing, Landscaping, etc.
- Seasonal considerations for ranking weights (HVAC higher in summer)

### **Pulse Automation Integration**
- Track ranking and achievement data that correlates with Pulse conversion
- Power tier customers with high rankings = ideal Pulse prospects
- Achievement system should build toward automation service interest

Please create a comprehensive implementation plan breaking down each phase into specific tasks, then begin with Phase 1 implementation. Focus on building a robust, scalable foundation that will support our quality-first ranking philosophy and drive meaningful business growth through the achievement system.
