# Signup Flow Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for fixing and enhancing the signup flow in the AZ Business Services directory platform. The current system has critical gaps that are blocking user acquisition and revenue generation.

**Current Status**: ‚ùå **BROKEN** - Users cannot sign up or pay for services
**Business Impact**: $0 MRR, 0% conversion rate, high bounce rate
**Priority**: URGENT - Blocking all business growth

## Audit Findings

### ‚úÖ **What's Working Well**
- [x] Clerk authentication integration with React Router v7
- [x] Business claim flow with GMB OAuth and document verification
- [x] User dashboard with billing, claims, and settings
- [x] Business onboarding component structure
- [x] Plan feature gating system
- [x] Polar.sh billing integration foundation

### ‚ùå **Critical Issues Identified**

#### 1. **Missing Core Auth Routes** ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT
- **No `/sign-in` route** - Links point to non-existent pages

- **No auth redirect handling** - Users get 404s when trying to authenticate

#### 2. **Broken Paid Plan Integration** üí∞ HIGH PRIORITY
- **No Polar checkout implementation** - Billing page shows mock data only
- **No actual subscription creation** - Cannot upgrade to paid plans
- **No payment processing** - Revenue generation is completely blocked

#### 3. **Incomplete Business Creation Flow** üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **No direct business creation** - Only claiming existing businesses works
- **Missing business form completion** - Add-business flow is partial
- **No plan selection during onboarding** - Users can't choose plans upfront

#### 4. **Disconnected User Journey** ‚ú® LOW PRIORITY
- **No smooth flow** from signup ‚Üí business creation ‚Üí plan selection
- **No onboarding guidance** - Users are lost after authentication
- **No success/completion states** - Users don't know next steps

## Next Steps

1. **Review this document** with the development team
2. **Prioritize Phase 1** as urgent and critical
3. **Assign team members** to specific tasks
4. **Set up testing environment** for each phase
5. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** immediately

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Do not proceed with marketing or customer acquisition until Phase 1 is complete and tested. The current broken auth flow will result in 100% user frustration and negative brand impact.
