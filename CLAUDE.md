## Essential Commands

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start Convex backend (REQUIRED - run first)
npx convex dev

# 2. Start React Router frontend (in separate terminal)
npm run dev

# Type checking & validation
npm run typecheck

# Production build
npm run build

# Production server
npm start

# CSV import utilities
npm run import-csv        # Import single CSV file
npm run import-all-csv    # Import all CSV files in data/imports/
npm run migrate-urls      # Migrate business URL structure
npm run featured-businesses  # Manage featured business listings
```

### Important Development Notes
- **Always run both servers**: Convex backend (`npx convex dev`) AND React frontend (`npm run dev`)
- **Simplified Schema**: Complex Convex schema files moved to `disabled_convex_files/` to resolve TypeScript recursion issues
- **Admin Access**: Complex admin functions temporarily disabled - restore from `disabled_convex_files/` when needed

- **Performance**: Optimized builds with 3-4 second compilation times

### Restoration Instructions
When ready to restore full admin functionality:
1. Move files from `disabled_convex_files/` back to `convex/`
2. Gradually add complex schema fields while monitoring TypeScript compilation
3. Test admin functions incrementally to maintain system stability

### Security Considerations
- **Admin Authentication**: Role-based permissions with audit trail
