# üöÄ Pricing Page Complete Overhaul - Implementation Prompt

## üìã Project Overview

**Objective**: Transform the current 3-tier pricing page ($9 Starter, $29 Pro, $97 Power) into a comprehensive 4-tier model (Free, $9 Starter, $29 Pro, $97 Power) that reflects our new business strategy focused on AI-powered insights, feature-gated tiers, and strategic upgrade paths.

**Current Problem**: The existing pricing page doesn't include a free tier for business claiming and has outdated value propositions that don't align with our AI ranking system and consumer-first approach.

**Target Outcome**: A compelling pricing page that clearly communicates the value progression from free claiming through premium lead generation, with emphasis on AI insights, professional presentation, and featuring opportunities.

- **Unclear Value Progression**: Jump from $9 to $29 to $97 without clear benefit escalation
- **Mixed Value Props**: Some benefits don't align with current platform capabilities
- **No Featuring Explanation**: Pro tier "enhanced visibility" not clearly defined

### **Key Changes Required:**
1. **Add Free Tier** for business claiming and verification
2. **Redistribute AI Features** across all tiers with increasing sophistication
3. **Clarify Featuring Strategy** for Pro tier with multiple placement opportunities
4. **Update Lead Generation Messaging** to emphasize Power tier exclusivity
5. **Professional Presentation Ladder** showing clear visual progression

## üö® Critical Implementation Notes

### **AI Features Distribution (MOST IMPORTANT):**
The current pricing page incorrectly shows "AI-Enhanced Listing" only for Power tier. This MUST be corrected to show:
- **All tiers get AI insights** with increasing sophistication
- **Free**: Basic AI insights for consumers
- **Starter**: Enhanced AI insights + editing capability
- **Pro**: Professional AI presentation + competitive analysis
- **Power**: Advanced AI intelligence + real-time analysis

### **Featuring Strategy Explanation:**
Pro tier "featured placement" must be clearly explained as multiple opportunities across the platform, not just one featured spot. This is a core value differentiator.

### **Lead Generation Exclusivity:**
Only Power tier offers lead generation. This must be emphasized as the key upgrade driver and differentiation from competitors.

### **Free Tier Positioning:**
Free tier should feel valuable (not limited trial) while creating natural upgrade desire through demonstrated value of paid features.
