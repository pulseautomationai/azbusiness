# SSR to SPA Migration - Fix Summary

## Overview
Migrated React Router v7 application from SSR (Server-Side Rendering) to SPA (Single Page Application) mode due to compatibility issues with Vite 6. This document tracks all the fixes applied during the migration.

## Root Cause
- React Router v7 + Vite 6 SSR compatibility issues
- "module is not defined" errors in SSR mode
- React Router hooks being called during SSR without proper context

## Migration Strategy
1. Disabled SSR in `react-router.config.ts` (set `ssr: false`)
2. Converted all routes from server-side loaders to client-side data fetching
3. Updated authentication to use client-side Clerk hooks
4. Fixed console warnings and performance issues

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration
1. **react-router.config.ts**
   - Changed `ssr: true` to `ssr: false`
   - Simplified configuration for SPA mode

2. **vite.config.ts** 
   - Removed complex SSR configurations
   - Simplified to basic setup with reactRouter(), tailwindcss(), tsconfigPaths()

3. **app/root.tsx**
   - Added `publishableKey` prop to ClerkProvider for SPA mode
   - Added HydrateFallback export (only allowed on root route in SPA mode)
   - Removed unnecessary image preloads

### Routes Converted from Loader to Client-Side
4. **app/routes/categories.tsx**
   - Disabled loader function
   - Added `useQuery(api.categories.getCategoriesWithCount)` for client-side data fetching
   - Added loading states

5. **app/routes/city/$city.tsx**
   - Disabled loader function
   - Added `useParams()` and `useQuery` hooks for client-side data fetching
   - Added loading states and Navigate redirect for missing cities
   - Implemented business category filtering logic client-side

6. **app/routes/pricing.tsx**
   - Disabled loader function
   - Added `useUser()` hook for client-side authentication
   - Removed loaderData dependencies

7. **app/routes/add-business.tsx**
   - Disabled loader function
   - Added `useUser()` hook for client-side authentication
   - Updated conditional rendering for signed-in users

8. **app/routes/blog/$slug.tsx**
   - Disabled loader function
   - Added `useParams()` for URL slug extraction
   - Added sample blog posts data for client-side rendering
   - Added Navigate redirect for missing posts

9. **app/routes/category/$category.tsx**
   - Disabled loader function
   - Added `useParams()` and `useQuery` hooks for client-side data fetching
   - Added loading states and Navigate redirect for missing categories

10. **app/routes/[$category].[$city].[$businessName].tsx**
    - Disabled loader function
    - Added `useParams()`, `useQuery`, and `useUser()` hooks
    - Implemented slug reconstruction logic client-side
    - Added conditional querying for related businesses using "skip" pattern
    - Added loading states and Navigate redirect for missing businesses

### Component Updates
11. **app/utils/logger.ts**
    - Fixed "process is not defined" error by changing `process.env` to `import.meta.env`
    - Updated environment variable checks for browser compatibility

12. **app/components/dashboard/app-sidebar.tsx**
    - Updated sidebar title from "Ras Mic Inc." to "AZ Business Services"

### Console Warnings Fixed
- Removed HydrateFallback from individual routes (only allowed on root in SPA mode)
- Removed unnecessary favicon preloads
- Fixed performance logging environment variable checks
- Updated Analytics component with `debug={false}`

## Routes Successfully Fixed
- `/` - Homepage (already working)
- `/categories` - Category listing page
- `/category/hvac-services` - Individual category pages
- `/city/phoenix` - Individual city pages  
- `/pricing` - Pricing page
- `/add-business` - Add business page
- `/blog` - Blog listing page
- `/blog/local-seo-arizona-cities` - Individual blog posts
- `/hvac-services/phoenix/reliance-heating-and-air-conditioning` - Business detail pages
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard (already working with client-side auth)

## Key Technical Changes

### Authentication Pattern
- **Before**: Server-side `getAuth()` in loaders
- **After**: Client-side `useUser()` hook from Clerk

### Data Fetching Pattern
- **Before**: `fetchQuery()` in server-side loaders
- **After**: `useQuery()` hooks from Convex for client-side fetching

### Error Handling Pattern
- **Before**: `throw redirect()` in loaders
- **After**: `<Navigate to="/path" replace />` component

### Loading States
- **Before**: No loading states (data pre-loaded)
- **After**: Explicit loading states with user feedback

## Benefits of SPA Mode
1. **Compatibility**: Resolved React Router v7 + Vite 6 SSR issues
2. **Simplicity**: Eliminated complex SSR configuration
3. **Consistency**: Unified client-side data fetching pattern
4. **Performance**: Removed unnecessary console warnings and logs

## Future Considerations
- When React Router v7 + Vite 6 SSR compatibility improves, could consider migrating back
- Current SPA setup provides stable foundation for continued development
- All routes now follow consistent client-side patterns
