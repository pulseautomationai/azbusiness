## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema (Already Defined)
```typescript
reviews: {
  businessId: Id<"businesses">,
  reviewId: string,           // External review ID for deduplication
  userName: string,
  rating: number,            // 1-5 scale
  comment: string,
  verified: boolean,
  source: "gmb_api" | "gmb_import" | "facebook" | "yelp" | "direct",
  originalCreateTime?: string,
  originalUpdateTime?: string,
  syncedAt?: number,
  importBatchId?: Id<"importBatches">,
  
  // AI Enhancement Fields
  sentiment?: {
    score: number,           // -1 to 1
    magnitude: number,       // 0 to 1
    classification: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative",
  },
  keywords?: string[],
  topics?: string[],
  
  createdAt: number,
}
```

### CSV Format Support
```typescript
// Google My Business
Business_Name,Review_ID,Rating,Review_Text,Reviewer_Name,Created_Date,Owner_Reply

// Yelp  
business_name,review_id,stars,text,user_name,date

// Facebook
page_name,review_id,rating,review_text,reviewer_name,created_time,page_reply

// Generic
Business Name,Review ID,Rating,Review,Reviewer,Date
```

### Business Matching Algorithm
```typescript
interface BusinessMatch {
  businessId: Id<"businesses">;
  confidence: number;        // 0-100
  matchType: 'exact' | 'fuzzy' | 'address' | 'manual';
  reasoning: string;         // Human-readable explanation
}

// Matching Priority Order:
// 1. Exact: Name + Phone (95% confidence)
// 2. Fuzzy: Name similarity using Levenshtein distance (85%+)
// 3. Address: Normalized address matching (80%+)  
// 4. Manual: CSV contains business_id field (100%)
```

### Plan Enforcement Logic
```typescript
const checkReviewLimits = async (businessId: Id<"businesses">) => {
  const business = await ctx.db.get(businessId);
  const currentReviewCount = await ctx.db
    .query("reviews")
    .withIndex("by_business", q => q.eq("businessId", businessId))
    .collect()
    .length;
    
  const limits = { starter: 15, pro: 40, power: 100 };
  const limit = limits[business.planTier];
  
  return {
    canImport: currentReviewCount < limit,
    currentCount: currentReviewCount,
    limit: limit,
    remaining: Math.max(0, limit - currentReviewCount)
  };
};
```
