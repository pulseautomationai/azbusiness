## Business Listing Page — Component-Level Visibility Spec

This document defines the design and implementation plan for a dynamic, AI-enriched business listing page for an Arizona local business directory. It is built on a modern tech stack (React Router v7, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Convex, Clerk, and Polar.sh). This document should be used by Claude or other AI agents to generate implementation plans, component tasks, and developer checklists.

The goal is to:

1. Render rich listings by default (Power-tier), and use visibility logic to hide or disable features for Pro or Free tiers.
2. Make each listing valuable and persuasive enough to get the business to claim it.
3. Use AI and automation to enrich content, offer compelling upgrade paths, and manage everything scalably.

Below is the full component spec, data audit, and now a phased rollout plan.

```

### 🗄️ Convex Schema Overview (Database Planning)

> **Note:** The `csv-importer.ts` file must be aligned with this schema. All fields listed below should either be populated directly from the CSV or set with sensible defaults during import. Importer modules such as `field-mappings.ts`, `slug-generator.ts`, and `data-validator.ts` should match these models.

> Importer Requirements:
>
> - `plan_tier`: default to `'free'`
> - `claimed_by_user_id`: null unless pre-verified
> - `verified`: false by default
> - `created_at`: use Convex server timestamp
> - Normalize weekly hours from columns `Monday–Sunday`
> - Extract service options and offerings into structured arrays
> - Initialize `business_content` with null or placeholder values for optional enrichments (summary, hero, offers, audit, etc.)

This section outlines the core Convex tables and fields needed to support dynamic listings, editable content, AI enhancements, and plan gating.
