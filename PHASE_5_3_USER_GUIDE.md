## API Reference

### Authentication & Permissions

All Phase 5.3 endpoints require proper authentication and permissions:

- **Admin Functions**: Require `system_settings` or `platform_analytics` permissions
- **Business Functions**: Require business ownership or admin access
- **Public Functions**: None in Phase 5.3 (all require authentication)

### Error Handling

Standard error responses:
```javascript
{
  success: false,
  error: "Permission denied",
  code: "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS"
}
```

### Rate Limiting

All endpoints respect the existing rate limiting system:
- Admin endpoints: Higher limits for system operations
- Business endpoints: Standard rate limits per user
- Bulk operations: Special handling for large data sets

### Response Formats

Consistent response structure:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: { /* endpoint-specific data */ },
  metadata: {
    timestamp: 1234567890,
    version: "1.0",
    processingTime: 150
  }
}
```

## Migration and Deployment Notes

### Database Migrations
Phase 5.3 adds 11 new database tables. All migrations are handled automatically by Convex when the schema is deployed.

### Backward Compatibility
All Phase 5.3 features are additive and do not break existing functionality. Existing business profiles and content remain unchanged.

### Performance Considerations
- ML operations may take 5-30 minutes depending on scope
- Bulk assessments are batched to prevent timeouts
- A/B test assignment uses deterministic hashing for consistency

### Security Features
- All sensitive operations require admin permissions
- Business data is protected by ownership checks
- ML recommendations include confidence scores for transparency
- Audit logs track all administrative actions

---

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ML Pipeline Timeouts**: Large analysis scopes may exceed time limits
   - **Solution**: Reduce scope or use batch processing

2. **Template Variable Errors**: Incorrect variable names or types
   - **Solution**: Validate template syntax before saving

3. **A/B Test Low Participation**: Insufficient traffic for statistical significance
   - **Solution**: Extend test duration or broaden audience

4. **Quality Assessment False Positives**: AI incorrectly flags good content
   - **Solution**: Manual override with admin notes

### Performance Optimization

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old experiments and assessments
2. **Index Monitoring**: Ensure database indexes remain optimized
3. **Cache Strategy**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Batch Operations**: Use bulk endpoints for large-scale operations

### Monitoring and Alerts

Key metrics to monitor:
- ML pipeline success rates
- Template application errors
- A/B test participation rates
- Quality assessment accuracy
- System performance during bulk operations
