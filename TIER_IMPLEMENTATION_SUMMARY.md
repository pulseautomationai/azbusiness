## Integration Points

### Database Schema
Added to businesses table:
```typescript
performanceData: {
  ranking?: number
  responseTime?: string
  satisfaction?: number
  areaAverage?: number
  competitivePosition?: string
  marketPosition?: string
}

aiInsights: {
  basic?: string[]
  enhanced?: string[]
  professional?: string[]
  premium?: string[]
}
```

### Route Integration
Updated `app/routes/[$category].[$city].[$businessName].tsx` to use `TierBasedBusinessProfile` component.

## Technical Architecture

### Type System
```typescript
export type TierLevel = 'free' | 'starter' | 'pro' | 'power';

export interface TierConfig {
  label: string;
  price: number;
  features: TierFeatures;
  styling: TierStyling;
  content: TierContent;
}
```

### Component Factory Pattern
The ComponentFactory provides tier-specific component selection:
- `getHeaderComponent(tier)` - Returns appropriate header variant
- `getAIInsightsComponent(tier)` - Returns AI insights variant
- `getContactComponent(tier)` - Returns contact section variant
- `getServicesComponent(tier)` - Returns services display variant

### Conditional Rendering
TierAwareComponent handles feature gating:
```typescript
<TierAwareComponent tier={tier} feature="showImageGallery">
  <ImageGallery images={images} />
</TierAwareComponent>
```

## Error Resolutions

### Fixed Issues:
1. **CSS Animation Error**: Replaced Tailwind's `@apply animate-fade-in` with standard CSS animation
2. **Import Path Issues**: Changed all "@/" imports to "~/" for proper resolution
3. **Convex Type Error**: Updated planTier from string to union type literal
4. **Dev Server Issues**: Resolved port conflicts and restarted on port 5173

## Testing Checklist
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors for tier system
- [x] All tier configurations are valid
- [x] Components render correctly for each tier
- [x] Feature gating works as expected
- [x] Upgrade prompts appear appropriately
- [x] Styling differences are clear between tiers
- [x] Mobile responsiveness maintained
- [x] No existing functionality broken
- [x] Tier updates trigger correct UI changes

## Next Steps
1. Connect tier updates to actual database mutations
2. Implement real-time subscriptions for tier changes
3. Add analytics tracking for tier upgrades
4. Create admin interface for managing business tiers
5. Add A/B testing for upgrade prompt effectiveness

## Notes
- The system gracefully handles missing planTier by defaulting to 'free'
- All components are designed to be easily extendable for new tiers
- The tier system is fully type-safe with TypeScript
- Visual hierarchy clearly communicates value proposition of each tier
